Angiotensin II is a potent vasopressor and aldosterone-stimulating peptide that controls blood pressure and fluid-electrolyte balance.
This angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) also inactivates the vasodilator protein,
bradykinin.
Accordingly,
the encoded enzyme increases blood pressure and is a drug target of ACE inhibitors,
which are often prescribed to reduce blood pressure.
This enzyme additionally plays a role in fertility through its ability to cleave and release GPI-anchored membrane proteins in spermatozoa.
Many studies have associated the presence or absence of a 287 bp Alu repeat element in this gene with the levels of circulating enzyme.
This polymorphism,
as well as mutations in this gene,
have been implicated in a wide variety of diseases including cardiovascular pathophysiologies,
psoriasis,

Regulation of the homologous ACE2 gene may be involved in progression of disease caused by several human coronaviruses,

It is also found on the red blood cell membranes,
where it constitutes the Yt blood group antigen.
Acetylcholinesterase exists in multiple molecular forms which possess similar catalytic properties,
but differ in their oligomeric assembly and mode of cell attachment to the cell surface.
It is encoded by the single ACHE gene,
and the structural diversity in the gene products arises from alternative mRNA splicing,
and post-translational associations of catalytic and structural subunits.
The major form of acetylcholinesterase found in brain,
muscle and other tissues is the hydrophilic species,
which forms disulfide-linked oligomers with collagenous,
or lipid-containing structural subunits.
The other,
alternatively spliced form,
expressed primarily in the erythroid tissues,
differs at the C-terminal end,
and contains a cleavable hydrophobic peptide with a GPI-anchor site.
It associates with the membranes through the phosphoinositide (PI) moieties added post-translationally.
AChE activity may constitute a sensitive biomarker of RBC ageing in vivo,
and thus,
may be of aid in understanding the effects of transfusion[provided by RefSeq,

and this enzyme is the first member of a new family of zinc-binding enzymes.
Mutations in this gene cause aminoacylase-1 deficiency,
a metabolic disorder characterized by central nervous system defects and increased urinary excretion of N-acetylated amino acids.
Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.
Read-through transcription also exists between this gene and the upstream ABHD14A (abhydrolase domain containing 14A) gene,
as represented in GeneID:100526760.
A related pseudogene has been identified on chromosome 18.

The alpha-2-adrenergic receptors are a type of adrenergic receptors (for adrenaline or epinephrine),
which inhibit adenylate cyclase.
These receptors include 3 highly homologous subtypes: alpha2A,
alpha2B,
and alpha2C.
They are involved in regulating the release of neurotransmitter molecules from sympathetic nerves and from adrenergic neurons in the central nervous system.
The sympathetic nervous system regulates cardiovascular function by activating adrenergic receptors in the heart,
blood vessels and kidney.
Studies in mouse revealed that both the alpha2A and alpha2C receptor subtypes were required for presynaptic transmitter release from the sympathetic nervous system in the heart and from central noradrenergic neurons.
The alpha-2-adrenergic receptors are also involved in catecholamine signaling by extracellular regulated protein kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) pathways.
A clear association between the alpha-2-adrenergic receptor and disease has not been yet established.

Aldehyde dehydrogenase is the next enzyme after alcohol dehydrogenase in the major pathway of alcohol metabolism.
There are two major aldehyde dehydrogenase isozymes in the liver,
cytosolic and mitochondrial,

Aldehyde dehydrogenase is the second enzyme of the major oxidative pathway of alcohol metabolism.
Two major liver isoforms of aldehyde dehydrogenase,
cytosolic and mitochondrial,

and subcellular localizations.
Most Caucasians have two major isozymes,
while approximately 50% of East Asians have the cytosolic isozyme but not the mitochondrial isozyme.
A remarkably higher frequency of acute alcohol intoxication among East Asians than among Caucasians could be related to the absence of a catalytically active form of the mitochondrial isozyme.
The increased exposure to acetaldehyde in individuals with the catalytically inactive form may also confer greater susceptibility to many types of cancer.
This gene encodes a mitochondrial isoform,
which has a low Km for acetaldehydes,
and is localized in mitochondrial matrix.

This protein is a potent mediator of new blood vessel formation and thus,

is commonly called angiogenin.
This protein induces angiogenesis after binding to actin on the surface of endothelial cells.
This protein also accumulates at the nucleolus where it stimulates ribosomal transcription.
Under stress conditions this protein translocates to the cytosol where it hydrolyzes cellular tRNAs and influences protein synthesis.
A signal peptide is cleaved from the precursor protein to produce a mature protein which contains a nuclear localization signal,
a cell binding motif,
and a catalytic domain.
This protein has been shown to be both neurotrophic and neuroprotective and the mature protein has antimicrobial activity against some bacteria and fungi,
including S.
pneumoniae and C.
albicans.
Due to its effect on rRNA production and angiogenesis this gene plays important roles in cell growth and tumor progression.
Mutations in this gene are associated with progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
This gene and the neighboring RNase4 gene share promoters and 5' exons though each gene then splices to a distinct 3' exon containing the complete coding region of each gene.
Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding the same protein.

Ankyrins play key roles in activities such as cell motility,

Most ankyrins are typically composed of three structural domains: an amino-terminal domain containing multiple ankyrin repeats; a central region with a highly conserved spectrin binding domain; and a carboxy-terminal regulatory domain which is the least conserved and subject to variation.
The protein encoded by this gene is required for targeting and stability of Na/Ca exchanger 1 in cardiomyocytes.
Mutations in this gene cause long QT syndrome 4 and cardiac arrhythmia syndrome.
Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described.

and also in other plasma membranes.
In the small intestine aminopeptidase N plays a role in the final digestion of peptides generated from hydrolysis of proteins by gastric and pancreatic proteases.
Its function in proximal tubular epithelial cells and other cell types is less clear.
The large extracellular carboxyterminal domain contains a pentapeptide consensus sequence characteristic of members of the zinc-binding metalloproteinase superfamily.
Sequence comparisons with known enzymes of this class showed that CD13 and aminopeptidase N are identical.
The latter enzyme was thought to be involved in the metabolism of regulatory peptides by diverse cell types,
including small intestinal and renal tubular epithelial cells,
macrophages,
granulocytes,
and synaptic membranes from the CNS.
This membrane-bound zinc metalloprotease is known to serve as a receptor for the HCoV-229E alphacoronavirus as well as other non-human coronaviruses.

tumor growth,
and metastasis and defects in this gene are associated with various types of leukemia and lymphoma.

which is part of the RAS superfamily.
The ARF genes encode small guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that stimulate the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of cholera toxin and play a role in vesicular trafficking and as activators of phospholipase D.
The product of this gene is localized to the plasma membrane,
and regulates vesicular trafficking,
remodelling of membrane lipids,
and signaling pathways that lead to actin remodeling.
A pseudogene of this gene is located on chromosome 7.

a class of neurological and neuromuscular disorders caused by expansion of short stretches of repetitive DNA.
The protein encoded by this gene has two globular domains near the N-terminus,

The encoded cytoplasmic protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane,
is involved in endocytosis,
and modulates mTOR signals,
modifying ribosomal translation and mitochondrial function.
The N-terminal region of the protein contains a polyglutamine tract of 14-31 residues that can be expanded in the pathogenic state to 32-200 residues.
Intermediate length expansions of this tract increase susceptibility to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
while long expansions of this tract result in spinocerebellar ataxia-2,

neurodegenerative disorder.
Genome-wide association studies indicate that loss-of-function mutations in this gene may be associated with susceptibility to type I diabetes,
obesity and hypertension.

They encode type II membrane-bound glycoproteins that appear to have exclusive specificity for the donor substrate UDP-galactose; all transfer galactose in a beta1,4 linkage to similar acceptor sugars: GlcNAc,
Glc,
and Xyl.
Each beta4GalT has a distinct function in the biosynthesis of different glycoconjugates and saccharide structures.
As type II membrane proteins,
they have an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence that directs the protein to the Golgi apparatus and which then remains uncleaved to function as a transmembrane anchor.
By sequence similarity,
the beta4GalTs form four groups: beta4GalT1 and beta4GalT2,
beta4GalT3 and beta4GalT4,
beta4GalT5 and beta4GalT6,
and beta4GalT7.
This gene is unique among the beta4GalT genes because it encodes an enzyme that participates both in glycoconjugate and lactose biosynthesis.
For the first activity,
the enzyme adds galactose to N-acetylglucosamine residues that are either monosaccharides or the nonreducing ends of glycoprotein carbohydrate chains.
The second activity is restricted to lactating mammary tissues where the enzyme forms a heterodimer with alpha-lactalbumin to catalyze UDP-galactose + D-glucose <=> UDP + lactose.
The two enzymatic forms result from alternate transcription initiation sites and post-translational processing.
Two transcripts,
which differ only at the 5' end,
with approximate lengths of 4.1 kb and 3.9 kb encode the same protein.
The longer transcript encodes the type II membrane-bound,
trans-Golgi resident protein involved in glycoconjugate biosynthesis.
The shorter transcript encodes a protein which is cleaved to form the soluble lactose synthase.

This cytokine may also play a role in mediating homing of lymphocytes to cutaneous sites.
It specifically binds to chemokine receptor 10 (CCR10).
Studies of a similar murine protein indicate that these protein-receptor interactions have a pivotal role in T cell-mediated skin inflammation.

whose members are characterized by a dramatic periodicity in protein abundance through the cell cycle.
Cyclins function as regulators of CDK kinases.
Different cyclins exhibit distinct expression and degradation patterns which contribute to the temporal coordination of each mitotic event.
This cyclin forms a complex with and functions as a regulatory subunit of CDK2,
whose activity is required for cell cycle G1/S transition.
This protein accumulates at the G1-S phase boundary and is degraded as cells progress through S phase.
Overexpression of this gene has been observed in many tumors,
which results in chromosome instability,
and thus may contribute to tumorigenesis.
This protein was found to associate with,
and be involved in,
the phosphorylation of NPAT protein (nuclear protein mapped to the ATM locus),
which participates in cell-cycle regulated histone gene expression and plays a critical role in promoting cell-cycle progression in the absence of pRB.

 Sequence Note: This RefSeq record was created from transcript and genomic sequence data to make the sequence consistent with the reference genome assembly.
The genomic coordinates used for the transcript record were based on transcript alignments.
An in-frame AUG is located 41 codons upstream of the annotated translation start site but is not being annotated as a start site since it is not conserved and is in a weak Kozak sequence context.
 CCDS Note: This CCDS representation contains an upstream in-frame start codon that could result in a longer protein N-terminus.
However,
a downstream start codon is annotated because use of the upstream start codon would eliminate an N-terminal signal peptide,
whose presence is consistent with functional support for CD300 family members (e.g.,
PMIDs 16920917,
19359216).

The encoded protein is a receptor on antigen-presenting cells of the immune system and is essential for mediating a broad variety of immune and inflammatory responses including T cell-dependent immunoglobulin class switching,
memory B cell development,
and germinal center formation.
AT-hook transcription factor AKNA is reported to coordinately regulate the expression of this receptor and its ligand,
which may be important for homotypic cell interactions.
Adaptor protein TNFR2 interacts with this receptor and serves as a mediator of the signal transduction.
The interaction of this receptor and its ligand is found to be necessary for amyloid-beta-induced microglial activation,
and thus is thought to be an early event in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis.
Mutations affecting this gene are the cause of autosomal recessive hyper-IgM immunodeficiency type 3 (HIGM3).
Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene encoding distinct isoforms have been reported.

Eleven pseudogenes of the CEA cell adhesion molecule subgroup are also found in the cluster.

Subsequently,
it was found to be a cell-cell adhesion molecule detected on leukocytes,
epithelia,

The encoded protein mediates cell adhesion via homophilic as well as heterophilic binding to other proteins of the subgroup.
Multiple cellular activities have been attributed to the encoded protein,
including roles in the differentiation and arrangement of tissue three-dimensional structure,
angiogenesis,
apoptosis,
tumor suppression,
metastasis,
and the modulation of innate and adaptive immune responses.
Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been reported,

part of the cadherin superfamily.
The flamingo subfamily consists of nonclassic-type cadherins; a subpopulation that does not interact with catenins.
The flamingo cadherins are located at the plasma membrane and have nine cadherin domains,
seven epidermal growth factor-like repeats and two laminin A G-type repeats in their ectodomain.
They also have seven transmembrane domains,
a characteristic unique to this subfamily.
It is postulated that these proteins are receptors involved in contact-mediated communication,
with cadherin domains acting as homophilic binding regions and the EGF-like domains involved in cell adhesion and receptor-ligand interactions.
The specific function of this particular member has not been determined.

This collagen is one of the multiplexins,
extracellular matrix proteins that contain multiple triple-helix domains (collagenous domains) interrupted by non-collagenous domains.
A long isoform of the protein has an N-terminal domain that is homologous to the extracellular part of frizzled receptors.
Proteolytic processing at several endogenous cleavage sites in the C-terminal domain results in production of endostatin,
a potent antiangiogenic protein that is able to inhibit angiogenesis and tumor growth.
Mutations in this gene are associated with Knobloch syndrome.
The main features of this syndrome involve retinal abnormalities,
so type XVIII collagen may play an important role in retinal structure and in neural tube closure.
Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate the mature neuropeptide hormone.
In response to stress,
this hormone is secreted by the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus,
binds to corticotropin releasing hormone receptors and stimulates the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone from the pituitary gland.
Marked reduction in this protein has been observed in association with Alzheimer's disease.
Autosomal recessive hypothalamic corticotropin deficiency has multiple and potentially fatal metabolic consequences including hypoglycemia and hepatitis.
In addition to production in the hypothalamus,
this protein is also synthesized in peripheral tissues,
such as T lymphocytes,
and is highly expressed in the placenta.
In the placenta it is a marker that determines the length of gestation and the timing of parturition and delivery.
A rapid increase in circulating levels of the hormone occurs at the onset of parturition,
suggesting that,
in addition to its metabolic functions,
this protein may act as a trigger for parturition.

and gamma families; beta and gamma crystallins are also considered as a superfamily.
Alpha and beta families are further divided into acidic and basic groups.
Seven protein regions exist in crystallins: four homologous motifs,
a connecting peptide,
and N- and C-terminal extensions.
Gamma-crystallins are a homogeneous group of highly symmetrical,
monomeric proteins typically lacking connecting peptides and terminal extensions.
They are differentially regulated after early development.
Four gamma-crystallin genes (gamma-A through gamma-D) and three pseudogenes (gamma-E,
gamma-F,
gamma-G) are tandemly organized in a genomic segment as a gene cluster.
Whether due to aging or mutations in specific genes,
gamma-crystallins have been involved in cataract formation.

The former class is also called phylogenetically-restricted crystallins.
The latter class constitutes the major proteins of vertebrate eye lens and maintains the transparency and refractive index of the lens.
This gene encodes a taxon-specific crystallin protein that binds NADPH and has sequence similarity to bacterial ornithine cyclodeaminases.
The encoded protein does not perform a structural role in lens tissue,
and instead it binds thyroid hormone for possible regulatory or developmental roles.
Mutations in this gene have been associated with autosomal dominant non-syndromic deafness.

Although the five genes share a remarkably high degree of sequence identity,
they are expressed selectively in different tissues.
Alternative splicing generates additional isoforms of each of the five growth hormones,
leading to further diversity and potential for specialization.
This particular family member is expressed mainly in the placenta and utilizes multiple transcription initiation sites.
Expression of the identical mature proteins for chorionic somatomammotropin hormones 1 and 2 is upregulated during development,

The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8).
IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages,
neutrophils,
eosinophils,
T lymphocytes,
epithelial cells,
and fibroblasts.
It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection.
Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression.
IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).
This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis,
a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis.
This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction.
This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration,
invasion,
angiogenesis and metastasis.
This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor.
The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg,
sepsis).
This gene and other members of the CXC chemokine gene family form a gene cluster in a region of chromosome 4q.

PSCD family members have identical structural organization that consists of an N-terminal coiled-coil motif,

The coiled-coil motif is involved in homodimerization,
the Sec7 domain contains guanine-nucleotide exchange protein (GEP) activity,
and the PH domain interacts with phospholipids and is responsible for association of PSCDs with membranes.
Members of this family appear to mediate the regulation of protein sorting and membrane trafficking.
This encoded protein is involved in the control of Golgi structure and function,

This protein,
which is critical for proper mineralization of bone and dentin,
is present in diverse cells of bone and tooth tissues.
The protein contains a large number of acidic domains,
multiple phosphorylation sites,
a functional arg-gly-asp cell attachment sequence,
and a DNA binding domain.
In undifferentiated osteoblasts it is primarily a nuclear protein that regulates the expression of osteoblast-specific genes.
During osteoblast maturation the protein becomes phosphorylated and is exported to the extracellular matrix,
where it orchestrates mineralized matrix formation.
Mutations in the gene are known to cause autosomal recessive hypophosphatemia,
a disease that manifests as rickets and osteomalacia.
The gene structure is conserved in mammals.
Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene.

Elevated levels of dUTP lead to increased incorporation of uracil into DNA,

The protein directly interacts with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E),

Interaction of this protein with eIF4E inhibits complex assembly and represses translation.
This protein is phosphorylated in response to various signals including UV irradiation and insulin signaling,
resulting in its dissociation from eIF4E and activation of mRNA translation.

 Sequence Note: The 5'-most translation start codon is selected for this RefSeq due to conservation in other species.
The use of an alternative downstream start codon,
which has a stronger Kozak signal,
would result in a protein that is 25 aa shorter at the N-terminus.
Due to leaky scanning by ribosomes,
it is possible that both start codons are used.
The use of the downstream start codon is assumed in the literature (e.g.,
PMID:11278896),
but there is no experimental evidence indicating which start codon is preferentially used in vivo.

This single chain zymogen is converted to a two-chain serine protease with an heavy chain (alpha-factor XIIa) and a light chain.
The heavy chain contains two fibronectin-type domains,
two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains,
a kringle domain and a proline-rich domain,
whereas the light chain contains only a catalytic domain.
On activation,
further cleavages takes place in the heavy chain,
resulting in the production of beta-factor XIIa light chain and the alpha-factor XIIa light chain becomes beta-factor XIIa heavy chain.
Prekallikrein is cleaved by factor XII to form kallikrein,
which then cleaves factor XII first to alpha-factor XIIa and then to beta-factor XIIa.
The active factor XIIa participates in the initiation of blood coagulation,
fibrinolysis,
and the generation of bradykinin and angiotensin.
It activates coagulation factors VII and XI.
Defects in this gene do not cause any clinical symptoms and the sole effect is that whole-blood clotting time is prolonged.

Coagulation factor XIII is the last zymogen to become activated in the blood coagulation cascade.
Plasma factor XIII is a heterotetramer composed of 2 A subunits and 2 B subunits.
The A subunits have catalytic function,
and the B subunits do not have enzymatic activity and may serve as a plasma carrier molecules.
Platelet factor XIII is comprised only of 2 A subunits,
which are identical to those of plasma origin.
Upon activation by the cleavage of the activation peptide by thrombin and in the presence of calcium ion,
the plasma factor XIII dissociates its B subunits and yields the same active enzyme,
factor XIIIa,
as platelet factor XIII.
This enzyme acts as a transglutaminase to catalyze the formation of gamma-glutamyl-epsilon-lysine crosslinking between fibrin molecules,
thus stabilizing the fibrin clot.
Factor XIII deficiency is classified into two categories: type I deficiency,
characterized by the lack of both the A and B subunits; and type II deficiency,
characterized by the lack of the A subunit alone.
These defects can result in a lifelong bleeding tendency,
defective wound healing,
and habitual abortion.

Through its C-terminal death domain,
this protein can be recruited by TNFRSF6/Fas-receptor,

thus passing the substrate from one enzyme to another.
The protein is a member of the XPG/RAD2 endonuclease family and is one of ten proteins essential for cell-free DNA replication.
DNA secondary structure can inhibit flap processing at certain trinucleotide repeats in a length-dependent manner by concealing the 5' end of the flap that is necessary for both binding and cleavage by the protein encoded by this gene.

which includes proteases that process protein and peptide precursors trafficking through regulated or constitutive branches of the secretory pathway.
It encodes a type 1 membrane bound protease that is expressed in many tissues,
including neuroendocrine,
liver,
gut,
and brain.
The encoded protein undergoes an initial autocatalytic processing event in the ER and then sorts to the trans-Golgi network through endosomes where a second autocatalytic event takes place and the catalytic activity is acquired.
Like other members of this convertase family,
the product of this gene specifically cleaves substrates at single or paired basic residues.
Some of its substrates include proparathyroid hormone,
transforming growth factor beta 1 precursor,
proalbumin,
pro-beta-secretase,
membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase,
beta subunit of pro-nerve growth factor and von Willebrand factor.
It is thought to be one of the proteases responsible for the activation of HIV envelope glycoproteins gp160 and gp140,
and may play a role in tumor progression.
Unlike SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses,
the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be uniquely cleaved by this protease.

 Sequence Note: A downstream translational start codon is selected for this RefSeq based on transcript support and on the presence of a predicted signal peptide in the protein N-terminus.
Several upstream in-frame start codons are also present with sparse transcript support,
and would result in proteins that are up to 83 aa longer at the N-terminus and lack predicted signal peptides.
Leaky scanning by ribosomes may allow translation initiation at the downstream start codon.

ghrelin and obestatin.
Ghrelin is a powerful appetite stimulant and plays an important role in energy homeostasis.
Its secretion is initiated when the stomach is empty,
whereupon it binds to the growth hormone secretagogue receptor in the hypothalamus which results in the secretion of growth hormone (somatotropin).
Ghrelin is thought to regulate multiple activities,
including hunger,
reward perception via the mesolimbic pathway,
gastric acid secretion,
gastrointestinal motility,
and pancreatic glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.
It was initially proposed that obestatin plays an opposing role to ghrelin by promoting satiety and thus decreasing food intake,
but this action is still debated.
Recent reports suggest multiple metabolic roles for obestatin,
including regulating adipocyte function and glucose metabolism.
Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
In addition,
antisense transcripts for this gene have been identified and may potentially regulate ghrelin-obestatin preproprotein expression.

Gli family zinc finger proteins are mediators of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling and they are implicated as potent oncogenes in the embryonal carcinoma cell.
The protein encoded by this gene localizes to the cytoplasm and activates patched Drosophila homolog (PTCH) gene expression.
It is also thought to play a role during embryogenesis.

and mediates platelet adhesion in the arterial circulation.
GPIb alpha chain provides the VWF binding site,

Mutations in the GPIb beta subunit have been associated with Bernard-Soulier syndrome,
velocardiofacial syndrome and giant platelet disorder.
The 206 amino acid precursor of GPIb beta is synthesized from a 1.0 kb mRNA expressed in plateletes and megakaryocytes.
A 411 amino acid protein arising from a longer,
unspliced transcript in endothelial cells has been described; however,
the authenticity of this product has been questioned.
Yet another less abundant GPIb beta mRNA species of 3.5 kb,
expressed in nonhematopoietic tissues such as endothelium,
brain and heart,
was shown to result from inefficient usage of a non-consensus polyA signal in the neighboring upstream gene (SEPT5,

In the absence of polyadenylation from its own imperfect site,
the SEPT5 gene produces read-through transcripts that use the consensus polyA signal of this gene.

 Heat shock factor binding protein 1 (HSBP1),
is a 76-amino-acid protein that binds to heat shock factor 1(HSF1),
which is a transcription factor involved in the HS response.
 During HS response,
HSF1 undergoes conformational transition from an inert non-DNA-binding monomer to active functional trimers.
HSBP1 is nuclear-localized and interacts  with the active trimeric state of HSF1 to negatively regulate HSF1 DNA-binding activity.
Overexpression of HSBP1 in mammalian cells represses the transactivation activity of HSF1.
When overexpressed in C.elegans HSBP1 has severe effects on survival of the animals after thermal and chemical stress consistent with a role of HSBP1 as a negative regulator of heat shock response.

etc.,
and it plays essential roles in multiple biological activities.
Perlecan is a key component of the vascular extracellular matrix,
where it helps to maintain the endothelial barrier function.
It is a potent inhibitor of smooth muscle cell proliferation and is thus thought to help maintain vascular homeostasis.
It can also promote growth factor (e.g.,
FGF2) activity and thus stimulate endothelial growth and re-generation.
It is a major component of basement membranes,
where it is involved in the stabilization of other molecules as well as being involved with glomerular permeability to macromolecules and cell adhesion.
Mutations in this gene cause Schwartz-Jampel syndrome type 1,
Silverman-Handmaker type of dyssegmental dysplasia,
and tardive dyskinesia.
Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.

it also promotes allergic airway inflammation.
Moreover,
IL-4,
a type 2 cytokine,
mediates and regulates a variety of human host responses such as allergic,
anti-parasitic,

and acute inflammation.
This cytokine has been reported to promote resolution of neutrophil-mediated acute lung injury.
In an allergic response,
IL-4 has an essential role in the production of allergen-specific immunoglobin (Ig) E.

NK cells preferentially express several calcium-dependent (C-type) lectins,
which have been implicated in the regulation of NK cell function.
The NKG2 gene family is located within the NK complex,
a region that contains several C-type lectin genes preferentially expressed in NK cells.
This gene encodes a member of the NKG2 family.
The encoded transmembrane protein is characterized by a type II membrane orientation (has an extracellular C terminus) and the presence of a C-type lectin domain.
It binds to a diverse family of ligands that include MHC class I chain-related A and B proteins and UL-16 binding proteins,
where ligand-receptor interactions can result in the activation of NK and T cells.
The surface expression of these ligands is important for the recognition of stressed cells by the immune system,
and thus this protein and its ligands are therapeutic targets for the treatment of immune diseases and cancers.
Read-through transcription exists between this gene and the upstream KLRC4 (killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily C,
member 4) family member in the same cluster.

Gram-negative bacteria contain a glycolipid,

Together with bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (BPI),
the encoded protein binds LPS and interacts with the CD14 receptor,
probably playing a role in regulating LPS-dependent monocyte responses.
Studies in mice suggest that the encoded protein is necessary for the rapid acute-phase response to LPS but not for the clearance of LPS from circulation.
This protein is part of a family of structurally and functionally related proteins,

plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP),
and phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP).

 Sequence Note: A downstream translational start codon is selected for this RefSeq based on its better conservation in mammalian species and on the presence of a predicted signal peptide in the protein N-terminus.
An upstream in-frame start codon is also present but is only conserved in primates,
and use of the upstream start codon would result in a protein that is 17 aa longer at the N-terminus and lacks a predicted signal peptide.
Leaky scanning by ribosomes may allow translation initiation at the downstream start codon.

low density lipoprotein-related protein 2 (LRP2) or megalin,
is a multi-ligand endocytic receptor that is expressed in many different tissues but primarily in absorptive epithilial tissues such as the kidney.
This glycoprotein has a large amino-terminal extracellular domain,
a single transmembrane domain,
and a short carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic tail.
The extracellular ligand-binding-domains bind diverse macromolecules including albumin,
apolipoproteins B and E,
and lipoprotein lipase.
The LRP2 protein is critical for the reuptake of numerous ligands,
including lipoproteins,
sterols,
vitamin-binding proteins,

This protein also has a role in cell-signaling; extracellular ligands include parathyroid horomones and the morphogen sonic hedgehog while cytosolic ligands include MAP kinase scaffold proteins and JNK interacting proteins.
Recycling of this membrane receptor is regulated by phosphorylation of its cytoplasmic domain.

Studies in other mammals suggest this protein plays a role in cell adhesion,
migration,
and axon guidance and,
in the developing brain,
neuronal migration.
In humans,
this gene is associated with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.

Proteins in this family are involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix in normal physiological processes,
such as embryonic development,
reproduction,
and tissue remodeling,

such as arthritis and metastasis.
The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate the mature protease.
This secreted protease breaks down proteoglycans,
fibronectin,
elastin and casein and differs from most MMP family members in that it lacks a conserved C-terminal hemopexin domain.
The enzyme is involved in wound healing,
and studies in mice suggest that it regulates the activity of defensins in intestinal mucosa.
The gene is part of a cluster of MMP genes on chromosome 11.
This gene exhibits elevated expression levels in multiple human cancers.

These receptors or isoforms are macrophage-specific trimeric integral membrane glycoproteins and have been implicated in many macrophage-associated physiological and pathological processes including atherosclerosis,
Alzheimer's disease,
and host defense.
The isoforms type 1 and type 2 are functional receptors and are able to mediate the endocytosis of modified low density lipoproteins (LDLs).
The isoform type 3 does not internalize modified LDL (acetyl-LDL) despite having the domain shown to mediate this function in the types 1 and 2 isoforms.
It has an altered intracellular processing and is trapped within the endoplasmic reticulum,

Mucins are high molecular weight,
O-glycosylated proteins that play an important role in forming a protective mucous barrier,

The encoded protein is a membrane-tethered mucin that contains an extracellular domain at its amino terminus,
a large tandem repeat domain,
and a transmembrane domain with a short cytoplasmic domain.
The amino terminus is highly glycosylated,
while the repeat region contains 156 amino acid repeats unit that are rich in serines,
threonines,

Three alternative splice variants,
each of which encodes a different isoform,
have been identified.

The encoded enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of modified nucleoside diphosphates,
including ADP-ribose (ADPR) and 8-oxoGua-containing 8-oxo-dADP and 8-oxo-dGDP.
Protein-bound ADP ribose can be hazardous to the cell because it can modify some amino acid residues,
resulting in the inhibition of ATP-activated potassium channels.
8-oxoGua is an oxidized form of guanine that can potentially alter genetic information by pairing with adenine and cytosine in RNA.
Presence of 8-oxoGua in RNA results in formation of abnormal proteins due to translational errors.

Oxytocin is a posterior pituitary hormone which is synthesized as an inactive precursor in the hypothalamus along with its carrier protein neurophysin I.
Together with neurophysin,
it is packaged into neurosecretory vesicles and transported axonally to the nerve endings in the neurohypophysis,
where it is either stored or secreted into the bloodstream.
The precursor seems to be activated while it is being transported along the axon to the posterior pituitary.
This hormone contracts smooth muscle during parturition and lactation.
It is also involved in cognition,
tolerance,
adaptation and complex sexual and maternal behaviour,
as well as in the regulation of water excretion and cardiovascular functions.

Along with PCBP-1 and hnRNPK,
it is one of the major cellular poly(rC)-binding proteins.

Together with PCBP-1,
this protein also functions as a translational coactivator of poliovirus RNA via a sequence-specific interaction with stem-loop IV of the IRES,
promoting poliovirus RNA replication by binding to its 5'-terminal cloverleaf structure.
It has also been implicated in translational control of the 15-lipoxygenase mRNA,

The encoded protein is also suggested to play a part in formation of a sequence-specific alpha-globin mRNP complex which is associated with alpha-globin mRNA stability.

an intronless gene with functions similar to that of PCBP2.

The encoded protein undergoes an initial autocatalytic processing event in the ER and then sorts to the trans-Golgi network through endosomes where a second autocatalytic event takes place and the catalytic activity is acquired.
This gene encodes one of the seven basic amino acid-specific members which cleave their substrates at single or paired basic residues.
It can process proalbumin and is thought to be responsible for the activation of HIV envelope glycoproteins gp160 and gp140.
This gene has been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of housekeeping genes and plays a role in the regulation of iron metabolism.

This gene is found in a cluster of related genes on chromosome 11,
each of which encodes one of multiple pepsinogens.
Pepsinogen levels in serum may serve as a biomarker for atrophic gastritis and gastric cancer.

Humans have multiple PtdIns proteins that differ by the degree and position of phosphorylation of the inositol ring.
This gene encodes an enzyme (PIKfyve; also known as phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate 5-kinase type III or PIPKIII) that phosphorylates the D-5 position in PtdIns and phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) to make PtdIns5P and PtdIns(3,5)biphosphate.

PIKfyve preferentially phosphorylates D-3 phosphorylated PtdIns.
In addition to being a lipid kinase,
PIKfyve also has protein kinase activity.

plasmin,
by several plasminogen activators such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA),
urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA),
kallikrein,
and factor XII (Hageman factor).
The conversion of plasminogen to plasmin involves the cleavage of the peptide bond between Arg-561 and Val-562.
Plasmin cleavage also releases the angiostatin protein which inhibits angiogenesis.
Plasmin degrades many blood plasma proteins,
including fibrin-containing blood clots.
As a serine protease,
plasmin cleaves many products in addition to fibrin such as fibronectin,
thrombospondin,
laminin,
and von Willebrand factor.
Plasmin is inactivated by proteins such as alpha-2-macroglobulin and alpha-2-antiplasmin in addition to inhibitors of the various plasminogen activators.
Plasminogen also interacts with plasminogen receptors which results in the retention of plasmin on cell surfaces and in plasmin-induced cell signaling.
The localization of plasminogen on cell surfaces plays a role in the degradation of extracellular matrices,
cell migration,
inflamation,
wound healing,
oncogenesis,
metastasis,
myogenesis,
muscle regeneration,
neurite outgrowth,
and fibrinolysis.
This protein may also play a role in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which,
in part,
is caused by enhanced clot formation and the suppression of fibrinolysis.
Compared to other mammals,
the cluster of plasminogen-like genes to which this gene belongs has been rearranged in catarrhine primates.

Ibeta,
and II).
These PRKG isoforms act as key mediators of the nitric oxide/cGMP signaling pathway and are important components of many signal transduction processes in diverse cell types.
This PRKG1 gene on human chromosome 10 encodes the soluble Ialpha and Ibeta isoforms of PRKG by alternative transcript splicing.
A separate gene on human chromosome 4,
PRKG2,
encodes the membrane-bound PRKG isoform II.
The PRKG1 proteins play a central role in regulating cardiovascular and neuronal functions in addition to relaxing smooth muscle tone,
preventing platelet aggregation,
and modulating cell growth.
This gene is most strongly expressed in all types of smooth muscle,
platelets,
cerebellar Purkinje cells,
hippocampal neurons,
and the lateral amygdala.
Isoforms Ialpha and Ibeta have identical cGMP-binding and catalytic domains but differ in their leucine/isoleucine zipper and autoinhibitory sequences and therefore differ in their dimerization substrates and kinase enzyme activity.

The protein encoded by this gene is a phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphatase.
It contains a tensin like domain as well as a catalytic domain similar to that of the dual specificity protein tyrosine phosphatases.
Unlike most of the protein tyrosine phosphatases,
this protein preferentially dephosphorylates phosphoinositide substrates.
It negatively regulates intracellular levels of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate in cells and functions as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating AKT/PKB signaling pathway.
The use of a non-canonical (CUG) upstream initiation site produces a longer isoform that initiates translation with a leucine,
and is thought to be preferentially associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane.
This longer isoform may help regulate energy metabolism in the mitochondria.

Renin is a part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system involved in regulation of blood pressure,

This enzyme catalyzes the first step in the activation pathway of angiotensinogen by cleaving angiotensinogen to form angiotensin I,
which is then converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin I converting enzyme.
This cascade can result in aldosterone release,
narrowing of blood vessels,
and increase in blood pressure as angiotension II is a vasoconstrictive peptide.

However,
depending on the cellular context,
this gene can act as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor.
The encoded protein is a member of the Kruppel-type zinc finger transcription factor family.
It represses transcription by binding a DNA sequence element called the neuron-restrictive silencer element.
The protein is also found in undifferentiated neuronal progenitor cells and it is thought that this repressor may act as a master negative regulator of neurogenesis.

Binding of ligands such as GDNF (glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor) and other related proteins to the encoded receptor stimulates receptor dimerization and activation of downstream signaling pathways that play a role in cell differentiation,
growth,
migration and survival.
The encoded receptor is important in development of the nervous system,

This proto-oncogene can undergo oncogenic activation through both cytogenetic rearrangement and activating point mutations.
Mutations in this gene are associated with Hirschsprung disease and central hypoventilation syndrome and have been identified in patients with renal agenesis.

the SART1(800) protein expressed in the nucleus of the majority of proliferating cells,
and the SART1(259) protein expressed in the cytosol of epithelial cancers.
The SART1(259) protein is translated by the mechanism of -1 frameshifting during posttranscriptional regulation; its full-length sequence is not published yet.
The two encoded proteins are thought to be involved in the regulation of proliferation.
Both proteins have tumor-rejection antigens.
The SART1(259) protein possesses tumor epitopes capable of inducing HLA-A2402-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes in cancer patients.
This SART1(259) antigen may be useful in specific immunotherapy for cancer patients and may serve as a paradigmatic tool for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with atopy.
The SART1(259) protein is found to be essential for the recruitment of the tri-snRNP to the pre-spliceosome in the spliceosome assembly pathway.

It has been implicated as the key inductive signal in patterning of the ventral neural tube,
the anterior-posterior limb axis,
and the ventral somites.
Of three human proteins showing sequence and functional similarity to the sonic hedgehog protein of Drosophila,
this protein is the most similar.
The protein is made as a precursor that is autocatalytically cleaved; the N-terminal portion is soluble and contains the signalling activity while the C-terminal portion is involved in precursor processing.
More importantly,
the C-terminal product covalently attaches a cholesterol moiety to the N-terminal product,
restricting the N-terminal product to the cell surface and preventing it from freely diffusing throughout the developing embryo.
Defects in this protein or in its signalling pathway are a cause of holoprosencephaly (HPE),
a disorder in which the developing forebrain fails to correctly separate into right and left hemispheres.
HPE is manifested by facial deformities.
It is also thought that mutations in this gene or in its signalling pathway may be responsible for VACTERL syndrome,
which is characterized by vertebral defects,
anal atresia,
tracheoesophageal fistula with esophageal atresia,
radial and renal dysplasia,
cardiac anomalies,
and limb abnormalities.
Additionally,
mutations in a long range enhancer located approximately 1 megabase upstream of this gene disrupt limb patterning and can result in preaxial polydactyly.

and appears to be the principal fatty acid transporter in enterocytes.
Clinical studies suggest this gene as a candidate gene for the insulin resistance syndrome.
Mutations in this gene have been associated with ichthyosis prematurity syndrome.

where it functions as a chloride/bicarbonate exchanger involved in carbon dioxide transport from tissues to lungs.
The protein comprises two domains that are structurally and functionally distinct.
The N-terminal 40kDa domain is located in the cytoplasm and acts as an attachment site for the red cell skeleton by binding ankyrin.
The glycosylated C-terminal membrane-associated domain contains 12-14 membrane spanning segments and carries out the stilbene disulphonate-sensitive exchange transport of anions.
The cytoplasmic tail at the extreme C-terminus of the membrane domain binds carbonic anhydrase II.
The encoded protein associates with the red cell membrane protein glycophorin A and this association promotes the correct folding and translocation of the exchanger.
This protein is predominantly dimeric but forms tetramers in the presence of ankyrin.
Many mutations in this gene are known in man,
and these mutations can lead to two types of disease: destabilization of red cell membrane leading to hereditary spherocytosis,
and defective kidney acid secretion leading to distal renal tubular acidosis.
Other mutations that do not give rise to disease result in novel blood group antigens,
which form the Diego blood group system.
Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO,
Melanesian ovalocytosis) results from the heterozygous presence of a deletion in the encoded protein and is common in areas where Plasmodium falciparum malaria is endemic.
One null mutation in this gene is known,
resulting in very severe anemia and nephrocalcinosis.

the endoprotease responsible for cleavage of insulin and hepatocyte growth factor receptors.
This protein is involved in endosomal trafficking from the plasma membrane to recycling endosomes or the trans-Golgi network.
Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
Read-through transcription also exists between this gene and the upstream ADP-ribosylation factor-like 2 (ARL2) gene.

possibly by acetylation and destabilization of nucleosomes.
The protein encoded by this gene is a transcriptional activator adaptor and a component of the histone acetyl transferase (HAT) coactivator complex which plays a crucial role in chromatin modulation and cell cycle progression.
Along with the other components of the complex,
this protein links transcriptional activators bound to specific promoters,
to histone acetylation and the transcriptional machinery.
The protein is also involved in the stabilization and activation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein that plays a role in the cellular response to DNA damage.
Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants of this gene.

The WD40 group is a large family of proteins,
which appear to have a regulatory function.
It is believed that the WD40 repeats mediate protein-protein interactions and members of the family are involved in signal transduction,
RNA processing,
gene regulation,
vesicular trafficking,
cytoskeletal assembly and may play a role in the control of cytotypic differentiation.
This encoded protein is found as a subunit in corepressor SMRT (silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid receptors) complex along with histone deacetylase 3 protein.
This gene is located adjacent to the ocular albinism gene and it is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of the ocular albinism with late-onset sensorineural deafness phenotype.
Four transcript variants encoding two different isoforms have been found for this gene.
This gene is highly similar to the Y chromosome TBL1Y gene.

The proteins encoded by this gene family are natural inhibitors of the matrix metalloproteinases,

In addition to an inhibitory role against metalloproteinases,
the encoded protein has a unique role among TIMP family members in its ability to directly suppress the proliferation of endothelial cells.
As a result,
the encoded protein may be critical to the maintenance of tissue homeostasis by suppressing the proliferation of quiescent tissues in response to angiogenic factors,
and by inhibiting protease activity in tissues undergoing remodelling of the extracellular matrix.

 Sequence Note: This RefSeq record was created from transcript and genomic sequence data to make the sequence consistent with the reference genome assembly.
The genomic coordinates used for the transcript record were based on transcript alignments.
 CCDS Note: This CCDS representation uses a downstream AUG start codon.
This start codon has a strong Kozak signal and is restricted to human.
An upstream start codon,
which has a weak Kozak signal and is conserved in some other primates,
is also present.
The use of the upstream start codon would result in a protein that is 40 aa longer at the N-terminus.
However,
this would eliminate a signal peptide that is predicted for the shorter but not the longer N-terminus.
PMID:9242611 shows experimental evidence for cleavage of a signal peptide following aa 25 from the downstream start,
and this is also confirmed in PMID:15340161.
Therefore,
the downstream start codon is represented for this CCDS.

Overexpression of Baff in mice results in mature B-cell hyperplasia and symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
Also,
some SLE patients have increased levels of BAFF in serum.
Therefore,
it has been proposed that abnormally high levels of BAFF may contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases by enhancing the survival of autoreactive B cells.
The protein encoded by this gene is a receptor for BAFF and is a type III transmembrane protein containing a single extracellular cysteine-rich domain.
It is thought that this receptor is the principal receptor required for BAFF-mediated mature B-cell survival.

The function of IAPs in TNF-receptor signalling is unknown,

The TnI subfamily contains three genes: TnI-skeletal-fast-twitch,
TnI-skeletal-slow-twitch,
and TnI-cardiac.
This gene encodes the TnI-cardiac protein and is exclusively expressed in cardiac muscle tissues.
Mutations in this gene cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy type 7 (CMH7) and familial restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM).
Troponin I is useful in making a diagnosis of heart failure,
and of ischemic heart disease.
An elevated level of troponin is also now used as indicator of acute myocardial injury in patients hospitalized with moderate/severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Such elevation has also been associated with higher risk of mortality in cardiovascular disease patients hospitalized due to COVID-19.

promoting non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathways,

This protein plays multiple roles in the DNA damage response,
including promoting checkpoint signaling following DNA damage,
acting as a scaffold for recruitment of DNA damage response proteins to damaged chromatin,
and promoting NHEJ pathways by limiting end resection following a double-strand break.
These roles are also important during V(D)J recombination,
class switch recombination and at unprotected telomeres.
Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.

This gene is induced by the tumor suppressor p53 and is thought to be involved in p53-mediated cell death.
It contains a p53 consensus binding site in its promoter region and a downstream pentanucleotide microsatellite sequence.
P53 has been shown to transcriptionally activate this gene by interacting with the downstream pentanucleotide microsatellite sequence.
The microsatellite is polymorphic,
with a varying number of pentanucleotide repeats directly correlated with the extent of transcriptional activation by p53.
It has been suggested that the microsatellite polymorphism may be associated with differential susceptibility to cancer.
Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

the peptidase family S1.
Tryptases are enzymatically active only as heparin-stabilized tetramers,
and they are resistant to all known endogenous proteinase inhibitors.
Several tryptase genes are clustered on chromosome 16p13.3.
These genes are characterized by several distinct features.
They have a highly conserved 3' UTR and contain tandem repeat sequences at the 5' flank and 3' UTR which are thought to play a role in regulation of the mRNA stability.
These genes have an intron immediately upstream of the initiator Met codon,
which separates the site of transcription initiation from protein coding sequence.
This feature is characteristic of tryptases but is unusual in other genes.
The alleles of this gene exhibit an unusual amount of sequence variation,
such that the alleles were once thought to represent two separate genes,
alpha and beta 1.
Beta tryptases appear to be the main isoenzymes expressed in mast cells; whereas in basophils,
alpha tryptases predominate.
Tryptases have been implicated as mediators in the pathogenesis of asthma and other allergic and inflammatory disorders.

the peptidase family S1.
Tryptases are enzymatically active only as heparin-stabilized tetramers,
and they are resistant to all known endogenous proteinase inhibitors.
Several tryptase genes are clustered on chromosome 16p13.3.
These genes are characterized by several distinct features.
They have a highly conserved 3' UTR and contain tandem repeat sequences at the 5' flank and 3' UTR which are thought to play a role in regulation of the mRNA stability.
Although this gene may be an exception,
most of the tryptase genes have an intron immediately upstream of the initiator Met codon,
which separates the site of transcription initiation from protein coding sequence.
This feature is characteristic of tryptases but is unusual in other genes.
Tryptases have been implicated as mediators in the pathogenesis of asthma and other allergic and inflammatory disorders.
This gene was once considered to be a pseudogene,
although it is now believed to be a functional gene that encodes a protein.

Tryptases are enzymatically active only as heparin-stabilized tetramers,

Several tryptase genes are clustered on chromosome 16p13.3.
There is uncertainty regarding the number of genes in this cluster.
Currently four functional genes - alpha I,
beta I,
beta II and gamma I - have been identified.
And beta I has an allelic variant named alpha II,
beta II has an allelic variant beta III,
also gamma I has an allelic variant gamma II.
Beta tryptases appear to be the main isoenzymes expressed in mast cells; whereas in basophils,
alpha-tryptases predominant.
This gene differs from other members of the tryptase gene family in that it has C-terminal hydrophobic domain,
which may serve as a membrane anchor.
Tryptases have been implicated as mediators in the pathogenesis of asthma and other allergic and inflammatory disorders.

The product of this gene is divided into two regions,
a N-terminal I-band and a C-terminal A-band.
The I-band,
which is the elastic part of the molecule,
contains two regions of tandem immunoglobulin domains on either side of a PEVK region that is rich in proline,
glutamate,
valine and lysine.
The A-band,
which is thought to act as a protein-ruler,
contains a mixture of immunoglobulin and fibronectin repeats,
and possesses kinase activity.
An N-terminal Z-disc region and a C-terminal M-line region bind to the Z-line and M-line of the sarcomere,
respectively,
so that a single titin molecule spans half the length of a sarcomere.
Titin also contains binding sites for muscle associated proteins so it serves as an adhesion template for the assembly of contractile machinery in muscle cells.
It has also been identified as a structural protein for chromosomes.
Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.
Considerable variability exists in the I-band,
the M-line and the Z-disc regions of titin.
Variability in the I-band region contributes to the differences in elasticity of different titin isoforms and,
therefore,
to the differences in elasticity of different muscle types.
Mutations in this gene are associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 9,
and autoantibodies to titin are produced in patients with the autoimmune disease scleroderma.

Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described.
There is also evidence for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons resulting in additional isoforms.
A recent study showed that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism,
and that this isoform is antiangiogenic.
Expression of some isoforms derived from the AUG start codon is regulated by a small upstream open reading frame,
which is located within an internal ribosome entry site.
The levels of VEGF are increased during infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
thus promoting inflammation by facilitating recruitment of inflammatory cells,
and by increasing the level of angiopoietin II (Ang II),
one of two products of the SARS-CoV-2 binding target,
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
In turn,
Ang II facilitates the elevation of VEGF,
thus forming a vicious cycle in the release of inflammatory cytokines.

and are involved in transduction of signals from receptors on the cell surface to the actin cytoskeleton.
 The presence of a number of different motifs suggests that they are regulated by a number of different stimuli,
and interact with multiple proteins.
 Recent studies have demonstrated that these proteins,
directly or indirectly,
associate with the small GTPase,
Cdc42,
known to regulate formation of actin filaments,
and the cytoskeletal organizing complex,
Arp2/3.
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is a rare,
inherited,
X-linked,
recessive disease characterized by immune dysregulation and microthrombocytopenia,
and is caused by mutations in the WAS gene.
The WAS gene product is a cytoplasmic protein,
expressed exclusively in hematopoietic cells,
which show signalling and cytoskeletal abnormalities in WAS patients.
 A transcript variant arising as a result of alternative promoter usage,
and containing a different 5' UTR sequence,
has been described,
however,
its full-length nature is not known.

and a transmembrane domain.
It is hypothesized that furin cleavage results in release of the mature protein from the plasma membrane for subsequent incorporation into the zona pellucida matrix.
However,
the requirement for furin cleavage in this process remains controversial based on mouse studies.
A variation in the last exon of this gene has previously served as the basis for an additional ZP3 locus; however,
sequence and literature review reveals that there is only one full-length ZP3 locus in the human genome.
Another locus encoding a bipartite transcript designated POMZP3 contains a duplication of the last four exons of ZP3,
including the above described variation,
and maps closely to this gene.

Previously,
this gene has been referred to as ZP1 or ZPB and thought to have similar functions as mouse Zp1.
However,
a human gene with higher similarity and chromosomal synteny to mouse Zp1 has been assigned the symbol ZP1 and this gene has been assigned the symbol ZP4.
